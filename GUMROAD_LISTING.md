---

## Tagline (140 chars)

The production-ready Next.js + tRPC + Prisma foundation that lets you skip the setup and start building what matters.

---

## The Story (Full Description)

### You Know the Feeling

It's 2 AM. You're excited about your new SaaS idea.

You spin up a Next.js project. Then you remember: auth. You need auth. And a database. And type-safe APIs. And that dashboard layout you've built five times before.

Three weeks later, you still haven't written a single line of *your* product. You've been configuring. Setting up. Debugging middleware.

**The graveyard of unshipped products isn't filled with bad ideas. It's filled with good ideas that died in setup purgatory.**

---

### What If You Could Skip to the Good Part?

Ownly is the starting point I wish I had.

It's not a tutorial. Not a boilerplate with TODO comments everywhere. It's a **production-ready foundation** with real components, real database models, and real patterns used by real SaaS products.

Clone it. Run it. Start building features on day one.

## What's Inside

### 🎨 24 Production UI Components

Beautiful, accessible, ready to use:
- **Data Tables** — Sorting, filtering, pagination
- **Forms** — Multi-step wizards with validation (Zod + React Hook Form)
- **Dashboard Layouts** — Responsive sidebar, header, content areas
- **Modals & Dialogs** — Accessible, keyboard-navigable
- **Command Palette** — Cmd+K search like the pros
- **Dropdowns, Tabs, Cards** — All the building blocks

### 🗄️ 15 Database Models (Prisma)

The schema you'd end up building anyway:
- Users, Profiles, Preferences
- Teams, Memberships, Invitations
- Subscriptions, Plans, Billing
- Invoices, Payments, Line Items
- Audit Logs, Sessions

### 🔐 Authentication Ready

- **Demo Mode**: No setup required — explore everything immediately
- **Production Mode**: Clerk integration with social login, passkeys, MFA
- **Protected Routes**: Already wired up
- **Session Management**: Handled

### ⚡ Modern Stack

| What | Technology |
|------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript (strict mode) |
| API | tRPC — end-to-end type safety |
| Database | Prisma + PostgreSQL |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui |
| State | React Query + Zustand |

## Who Is This For?

### ✅ You'll Love This If...

**You're a solo founder** shipping your first (or fifth) SaaS. You want to focus on features, not infrastructure.

**You're an agency** that builds client projects. You need a reusable, professional starting point.

**You're a developer** who's tired of reinventing wheels. You want to learn modern patterns from working code.

**You're a team** prototyping quickly. You need something better than create-next-app but less opinionated than a full framework.

### ❌ This Isn't For You If...

- You need a no-code solution (this is source code)
- You've never used React (you'll struggle)
- You want a hosted, finished product (this is a starting point)

---

## The Journey After Purchase

**Day 1**: Clone, install, run. Explore the dashboard. See how everything connects.

**Day 2**: Replace the branding. Update colors in Tailwind config. Make it yours.

**Day 3**: Start building your first feature. The boring parts are done.

**Week 1**: You're shipping to production while others are still configuring auth.
