Show HN: Ownly – SaaS Starter Kit with tRPC, Prisma, and Type Safety ($49)

I spent 3 months building Ownly because I was tired of expensive boilerplates 
(ShipFast: $279, MakerKit: $199) with limited customization.

Key differences:
• Type-safe APIs with tRPC (vs REST)
• 13 production database models
• 24 shadcn/ui components
• Works instantly (demo mode, no config)
• $49 (5.7x cheaper than competitors)

Happy to answer questions about the stack, pricing, or why I chose each technology.

### X/Twitter Thread
```
THREAD: I built a $49 alternative to $200 SaaS boilerplates.

Here's why it's actually better. 🧵

---

Problem: Most SaaS templates cost $150-300 and use REST APIs, custom components, 
and opinionated architecture that doesn't fit your product.

Ownly costs $49 and uses modern patterns you actually want.

---

The stack:
• Next.js 14
• tRPC (type-safe RPC, not REST)
• Prisma ORM
• shadcn/ui
• Clerk auth
• Zod validation

Why tRPC > REST?
When you change your backend schema, TypeScript catches frontend errors 
automatically. REST? You're guessing.

---

What's included:
✓ 13 production database models
✓ 24 components
✓ Demo mode (try it now, no setup)
✓ Clerk authentication
✓ Full source code
✓ Commercial license

---

The price:
ShipFast: $279
MakerKit: $199
Supastarter: $99
Ownly: $49

Not because I'm losing money. Because I don't have $200K/year marketing budget 
and I believe in accessibility.

---

Can you use it commercially?
Yes. Full license included.

Do you get updates?
Yes. Lifetime updates for one-time $49.

What if you don't like it?
72-hour refund. No questions asked.

### LinkedIn Post
```
Today I launched Ownly—a $49 SaaS boilerplate with type-safe APIs.

After 3 months of development, I'm excited to share something that solves a real 
problem for indie developers and founders: How to move fast without paying $200+ 
for bloated templates.

The market:
- ShipFast: $279 (battle-tested, large community)
- MakerKit: $199 (enterprise features)
- Supastarter: $99 (middle ground)
- Ownly: $49 (modern stack, instant demo)

Why I built it:
Every time I talked to founders, they complained about:
1. Setup taking 30+ minutes
2. REST APIs without type safety
3. Basic database schema (5-8 models vs. 13)
4. Price point out of reach for bootstrapped teams

So I built what I wanted to use.

The tech stack:
- Next.js 14 + tRPC (type-safe APIs)
- Prisma ORM (type-safe database)
- Clerk Auth (authentication ready)
- shadcn/ui (24 components)
- Zod (validation)

What ships:
✓ 13 production database models
✓ 24 UI components
✓ Working demo (no setup required)
✓ Full source code
✓ Lifetime updates

For founders and indie developers: This is built for people who want to move 
fast and ship real products.

For developers: This is the modern stack you want to use. tRPC, Prisma, TypeScript 
end-to-end. No REST API guessing.

Try it:
Demo: https://ownly-kit.vercel.app
Launch: [gumroad link]

Let me know what you think. Happy to discuss the architecture, pricing philosophy, 
or why I chose each technology.

Building in public. Let's go. 🚀
