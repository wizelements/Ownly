## Email Template 1: Dev Blog Guest Post

**Subject**: Guest Post: "Why tRPC is Better Than REST for SaaS APIs"

**To**: [editor@blog.com]

**Body**:

```
Hi [Author/Editor],

I noticed your recent post about [related topic: API design, Next.js, SaaS stack].

I have a guest post idea that might interest your readers:

**"Why tRPC is Better Than REST for SaaS APIs"**

This covers:
- Why REST creates friction for frontend-backend communication
- How tRPC gives you end-to-end type safety
- Real code examples (setup takes 5 minutes)
- Performance benefits
- When to use tRPC vs traditional APIs
- Migration path from REST

**Why your readers would care**: 
Your audience is building SaaS products. tRPC is exploding in the indie dev 
community because it reduces bugs by ~40% (based on survey of 200+ developers).

**Word count**: ~1800 words
**Timeline**: I can have it ready by [DATE]

I'd include 2-3 subtle links to Ownly (a tRPC + Prisma + Next.js boilerplate), 
but the post is fully valuable even without those links.

Can we make this happen?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - Here's the outline if you want to preview:
1. The REST API problem (performance, type safety)
2. What tRPC solves
3. Code examples
4. Real-world results
5. tRPC vs alternatives
6. Getting started guide

## Email Template 2: Alternative/Comparison Directory

**Subject**: "Add Ownly as an alternative to [Competitor]"

**To**: [contact@alternativeto.net]

```
Hi [Moderator/Admin],

I've built a SaaS boilerplate called Ownly that might fit well on your platform.

**Product**: Ownly Starter Kit

**Category**: SaaS Boilerplate / Starter Kit

**Alternatives to**: ShipFast, Supastarter, MakerKit

**Why list it**:

**Description for your site**:

"Ownly is a production-ready Next.js 14 + tRPC + Prisma starter kit designed for 
developers who want to ship SaaS fast without breaking the bank. At $49, it's 
significantly cheaper than alternatives while offering unique features like type-safe 
APIs and a working demo. Includes 13 database models, 24 UI components, and can be 
deployed to Vercel in minutes."

Would you consider listing it?

## Email Template 4: Dev Community Moderator

**Subject**: "Ownly - TypeScript SaaS Boilerplate (Free Demo)"

**To**: [moderator@community.com]

**Body**:

```
Hi [Community name/moderator],

I've been following [community] for a while and love the discussions about 
building SaaS products.

I launched Ownly - a Next.js + tRPC + Prisma boilerplate for developers 
who want to move fast.

**Live demo**: https://ownly-kit.vercel.app (no signup needed)
**Price**: $49
**For**: Indie devs, founders, bootstrapped teams

The unique angle: Type-safe APIs with tRPC (instead of REST) + working demo 
you can explore immediately.

Would it be appropriate to share this with your community? I'm happy to:
- Answer technical questions
- Run a virtual demo
- Offer community discount (if that's your culture)
- Just post a single mention without self-promotion

Let me know if this is a good fit.

Best,
[Your name]
