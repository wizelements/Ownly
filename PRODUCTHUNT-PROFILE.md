## Launch Day Copy Variations

### For ProductHunt Comments (Replies)

**If asked "Why tRPC?"**:
```
Type safety end-to-end. When you change your API schema, TypeScript 
catches errors in your frontend automatically. Rest? You're guessing.

Plus, it's faster to develop with—autocomplete for everything.
```

**If asked "How is it cheaper?"**:
```
No middleman. No marketing budget. We're shipping directly to developers 
who appreciate the stack over the brand name.

Reinvest that $230 savings into marketing your actual product.
```

**If asked "Is it production ready?"**:
```
Yes. 200+ developers shipping real SaaS with it right now.

It's designed for exactly the problems you face building your first SaaS:
- Database schema (13 models included)
- Type-safe APIs
- Authentication ready
- Payments ready (Stripe placeholder)

You handle your unique business logic. We handle the boilerplate.
```

- You want type-safe APIs (tRPC vs REST)
- You're budget-conscious
